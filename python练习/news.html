A subprocess should work if you run it with environment variables=20

<h2><a name="2">Shall I worry about python2/3 compatibility when using library?</a></h2>
<p>Hi there,

I think the fact is:
- There are still considerable amount of people still using python2
- Python2 user will eventually upgrade to python3

So any library not written in a compatible way will either break now for python2 user, or will break in the future for python3 user. So I suppose all library developer are writing compatible code, is that a fair assumption?

Thanks,
Stone</p>

No.  Many people write new libraries only for recent version of Python 
3.  Many people who have written Python 2 and 3 compatible libraries, or 
Python 2 and Python 3 versions of of their library, have or will drop 
Python 2 support for enhancements and even bugfixes for their library.

That said, some people will continue to use existing python 2 code for a 
decade or more.

Thanks for the reply Terry. Got it.

So some people main separate libraries for python2 and python3 (although this way it may have extra cost), and may eventually drop support for python2 lib or may not even have library for python2.

That depends on the developer and the library.

For myself, I try to write compatible code. For many things this is easy, and 
for most things this is possible, especially with the help of some kind of 
compatibility module like "six".

There are some tutorials on writing portable Python 3 code, and on porting 
Python 2 code.

I have a little module of my own "cs.py3" which covers most of the things I've 
needed to port; it aims to provide Python 3 flavoured versions of things. That 
way (a) my code expects Python 3 (where that matters) and (b) the code runs 
maximally efficiently under Python 3 because most of the things are just a 
direct import of the Python 3 builtin - the Python 2 code is the emulation (for 
want of a term).

Why my own? To some extent so I learn myself what's changed. Nothing like 
implenting something for Python 2 to match Python 3 for these things.

I'll assume you're aware of the main differences; if not we can elaborate.

Not everything can be done seamlessly, but you might be surprised how small an 
issue it usually is.

That said, I do have some modules which are Python 3 only. So far I think these 
are all modules doing byte level parsing of binary data - this is outstandingly 
easier in Python 3 - you're never unsure if you're dealing with bytes versus 
text (str). I was looking at making them Python 2 capable, but the pain level 
was too high.

My advice: try to be portable (same code good for both 2 and 3), try to port 
when this is an issue, try to use third party modules which work with both 2 
and 3 when you have a choice, look at the 'six" module if things get harder.

And aim for Python 2.7 - this goes a long way to making 2 and 3 easy to work 
with. The fursther back you go in 2.x the harder it gets.

Yep; also, aim for 3.5+, since you get the ability to write u"..."
(from 3.3) and b"..."%... (from 3.5). That can make your life quite a
bit easier.

It's not clear what you mean by "rounding mode" here. If you
mean whether it's up/down/even/whatever, then yes, you can
probably set that as a default and leave it.

However, as far as I can see, Decimal doesn't provide a
way of setting a default number of decimal places to
which results are rounded. You can set a default *precision*,
but that's not the same thing. (Precision is the total
number of significant digits, not the number of digits
after the decimal point.)

So if you're working with dollars and cents and want all
your divisions rounded to 2 places, you're going to have
to do that explicitly each time.

I don't think this is a bad thing, because often you
don't want to use the same number of places for everything,
For example, people dealing with high-volume low-value goods
often calculate with unit prices having more than 2 decimal
places. In those kinds of situations, you need to know
exactly what you're doing every step of the way.

Except that we don't, we actually have an impact screwdriver,
so you've going to have to bring your hammer to deal with
nails properly. And a single size of hammer isn't going to
suit all kinds of nail.

See https://python3statement.org/

Some older libraries that used to maintain a compatible codebase have 
already dropped Python 2 support, and other have moved to supporting new 
features on Python 3 only. Many will drop Python 2 support no later than 
2020.

Not really as many libraries dropped support for Python 2 some years 
back.  Just one example is the extremely popular plotting library 
matplotlib which has just put out release candidates for version 3.0.0. 
This only supports Python 3.5+.
